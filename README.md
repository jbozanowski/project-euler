project-euler
=============
A word of clarification: I'm not all that much interested in math/number theory aspects of the Project Euler challenges, so don't expect too much clever stuff here. I'm mostly sticking with brute force approaches, as long as they run in reasonable time and space on my laptop.

Ultimately, my goal is to have a set of easy, but non-trivial small programs to implement in any new languages I'm learning at the moment to get a more practical feel after reading the tutorials and whatnot.

For now, however, I'm trailblazing the challenges in Python.
